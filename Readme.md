# Running
## Pendulum Physics Simulation
Run the `pendulum.py` for the physics simulation

## AI Model
Run `NEAT.py` to train and let it control the physics simulation. Note: the model result is unintelligence - it spins the pendulum as fast as possible to obtain points. More work is needed to obtain a better result.
